              >incent Willem van Gogh (Dutch: [ˈvɪnsɛnt ˈʋɪləm vɑŋ ˈɣɔx]
              (listen);[note 1] 30 March 1853 – 29 July 1890) was a Dutch
              Post-Impressionist painter who posthumously became one of the most
              famous and influential figures in Western art history. In a
              decade, he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil
              paintings, most of which date from the last two years of his life.
              They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and
              self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and
              dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to
              the foundations of modern art. Not commercially successful in his
              career, he struggled with severe depression and poverty, which
              eventually led to his suicide at age thirty-seven. Born into an
              upper-middle class family, Van Gogh drew as a child and was
              serious, quiet, and thoughtful.</span

            >s a young man, he worked as an art dealer, often traveling, but
            became depressed after he was transferred to London. He turned to
            religion and spent time as a Protestant missionary in predominantly
            Roman Catholic southern Belgium. He drifted in ill health and solitude
            before taking up painting in 1881, having moved back home with his
            parents. His younger brother Theo supported him financially; the two
            kept a long correspondence by letter. His early works, mostly still
            lifes and depictions of peasant labourers, contain few signs of the
            vivid colour that distinguished his later work. In 1886, he moved to
            Paris, where he met members of the avant-garde, including Émile
            Bernard and Paul Gauguin, who were reacting against the Impressionist
            sensibility. As his work developed he created a new approach to still
            lifes and local landscapes. His paintings grew brighter as he
            developed a style that became fully realised during his stay in Arles
            in the South of France in 1888. During this period he broadened his
            subject matter to include series of olive trees, wheat fields and
            sunflowers .

            worried about his mental stability, he often neglected his physical
            health, did not eat properly and drank heavily. His friendship with
          Gauguin ended after a confrontation with a razor when, in a rage, he
          severed part of his own left ear. He spent time in psychiatric
          hospitals, including a period at Saint-Rémy. After he discharged
          himself and moved to the Auberge Ravoux in Auvers-sur-Oise near Paris,
          he came under the care of the homeopathic doctor Paul Gachet. His
          depression persisted, and on 27 July 1890, Van Gogh is believed to
          have shot himself in the chest with a revolver, dying from his
          injuries two days later. Van Gogh was commercially unsuccessful during
          his lifetime, and he was considered a madman and a failure. As he
          became famous only after his suicide, he came to be seen as a
          misunderstood genius in the public imagination.[6] His reputation grew
          in the early 20th century as elements of his style came to be
          incorporated by the Fauves and German Expressionists. He attained
          widespread critical and commercial success over the ensuing decades,
          and is remembered as an important but tragic painter whose troubled
          personality typifies the romantic ideal of the tortured artist. Today,
          Van Gogh's works are among the world's most expensive paintings to
          have ever sold, and his legacy is honoured by a museum in his name,
          the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, which holds the world's largest
          collection of his paintings and drawings.
